### Description

This repository is a self-imposed challenge to me (M3galodon) where I will built a project everyday to develop my technical skills.

This can be from basic to advance projects and the scope of the projects may vary from time to time.

#### INFORMATION and DISCLAIMER
The challenge was started in September 13, 2024. If I missed a project, the number of projects that I need to do in a day will increase (based on the number of days that I missed). So good luck to me.
